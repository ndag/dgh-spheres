## The correspondence from Appendix D of The [arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00611))
The matlab script corresp_s1_s2_app_D.m provides code for constructing the correspondence between S1 and S2 which is describdin the Appendix D of the ArXiv version of the paper. The code also computes its distortion.
